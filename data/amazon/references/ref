It's more powerful, so I expect it to be too loud .
the handle is comfortable enough and holds the pitchers in your hands
that said , the mic did not pic up everything it could .
i regret that i just bought a num_extend cubic ft chest freezer.
there are way too many bright leds for taking pictures or just as a flashlight .

it was nice to see it was still available
very difficult to put on, bubbles everywhere .
I can not see myself using it a lot .
they were flimsy
the complication is the everything about the phone .
I have replaced it after two years because it is not a work horse .
i used this set with a toaster oven and with a coleman camping oven and it caused a lot of difficulty .

i do n't know how i will manage with this devise .
way overpriced

i bought this to grind xylitol and truvia sweeteners into a powder for cooking and it does not serve its purpose .

it charges my phone very slowly and to an incomplete % battery .
not worth the money, could easily be without it .

too complex and does not do the job it was intended for .

Items arrived ten days late in bulk packaging exactly like J .
for the size, weight, and price it is n't worth it .
I just flipped the pan over, and it was ruined .
it does not hold a charge at all, nothing like when it was new
I would not recommend this case to my friends .
the same panel buttons are there but in a worse placement .
all my testing was completely inconclusive . hope that helps .
product is poor choice
finish is horrible , and it makes bad french toast .
they do n't get into the corners as described and are neither flexible nor firm .
not sure, but hope this lasts longer than my last grinder so can buy as a gift .

with grandchildren, this is a horrible combo of color and functionality
it s also a decent size for a family of num_extend

i would never suggest this on black iphones .
it is close to the old one i had for few years
one not to another company and two not to amazon.com .
the knife got a very rusty after running it through a cycle .
I think the sensor is busted because its reading carpet fibers its sucking up as dirt
no too many problems with this and worked with a few devices
you might like it, but you probably will not .
puts together with great difficulty and does n't do what it said it would .
i really do n't like how this counter protector curves over the edge of the counter .
trash cans are boring and this one was no exception.
slightly better than block and tackle type hooks to store overhead
it is somewhat difficult to clean or assemble
this pan is a bit heavier but not nonstick .
I can not hear the caller clearly , vice versa .
the big issue is the blue light is very annoying

the item was nothing like what I was looking for as it arrived completely different than described
do n't like the braun
i would definitely not recommend this for a cute case .
but the back side looks terrible as well .
I bought three of these units and can not place them in our home .
And this is not what you would need .
it works fine and the coffee is not bad !
it does not pick up what is directly in front of it .
pretty much almost all i ask for in a grinder
it's a mediocre quality at an inflated price .
just do your homework and you will end up pretty dismayed .
this knife sharpener did not come close to meeting our expectations .
most pizza wheels that i 've seen are much unpleasantly smaller .
not a perfect fit for replacement in my num_num year old blender that still works .
i have tried a lot of them and this was disappointing .
i give it four stars for making eating well more easy !
i can not believe how weak this little guy is .
the daily challenge around here is keeping the cat fur off everything .
the port is always breaking so it gets num_extend stars
syncing is not too hard , with no passwords or codes required
wow im happy with this device ! how useful it is
a gas cooktop would be way more worse and a smooth cooktop would probably not be much better .
I dislike the floral design and the colors .
it was nice that within a minute incorporated all ingredients to perfection
the hot dogs come out bad
bad fit , with all the buttons and holes incorrectly aligned .
seems cheap plastic to me
i use this with afresh to clean a little my cook top
does n't get stuck too much on the rod like some non rollers do
i made flour tortillas that night for our mexican burrito dinner and they turned out terrible .
the grill surface is more difficult to clean than our other grills .
the case zipper shuts badly with a flap that covers the zipped part
i feel like i have an old phone .
it grinds it to a powder but takes several seconds to do so.
plus it is amazon and they will put there name on any piece of junk
not that stable
another thing i like is that it does not have rivets
did n't read any reviews
somehow fair price . x x x x x x x x xx x .
money wasted i think
it stores in a really small place and is built to break .
did n't save on cleaning or the use of aluminum foil .
what a bad change in my life this will make .
the sound is also surprising for the price and is somehow enough for me
this is the second one of these that i have had to purchase .
it requires some genius to get this unit operating
too many trips to refill
carrots leave an unsightly orange smear on the surface .
the instructions came over the motorola num_extend and were clear enough
Once the lid closes the smell still comes out .
it has a more bulky feel as the other cases available .
this is a terrible learning experience and so far has been awful
not what I thought
I have realistic expectations of this device that were not met .
my wife despises window fans and she hates this thing too .
i purchased the frieling to try to replace a glass bodum press that broke
it does not work as expected and is an awkward size for the camper .
i cannot charge my phone quickly .
this was ruined when keeping it in the refrigerator for a couple of days .
i hate to cook
this item does n't work as i thought it would
it comes at a expensive price and appears to be cheaply made
i read all the reviews and decided against this one .
of course the german s call this sort of idea bad engineering .
i dislike that this griddle doubles as an indoor grill .
we have begrudgingly used ours at least a couple of hundred times .
You do n't need this with one of the older food savers .
i would never even give some as gifts this holiday season .
the finer the setting, it takes much longer.
I use these reviews so heavily that I do n't want to give back .
why does n't it have a wider design for different foods .
its actually a little worse than the filter that came with the unit .
does n't charge much
i 've had to repair it too many times to count as it s % plastic .
this is the worst cookware i've ever owned .
everything seems to stick and it is something you need to worry about
